Data Binding in Angular allows us to communicate between a component class and its corresponding view templates & vice-versa.
CAN BE Bidirectional relationship! Its mean we can get variable from class and embeded it in html. Also we can call methods!

onClick(){
this.display - true
}

<button (click) = "onClick*()"></button>

if we wrap attribute in [] and assign value this value is assign direct for this attribute

display = false;

<div [hidden] = "display"></div> -> in this case we set direct value in hidden with this syntaxis!
If we do not uie [] we assign string value of "display" to hidden! nice!

Property Biding:

<img [src] = "object.Img"></img>
<button [disable] = "object.boolean or method etc"></button>

to bind attribute [attr.aria-hidden]

event biding:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
we use () for event biding not [] alse use method instread propety

method(event:InputEvent/ any){
event.target.value -> when we trigger this event from html we ca pass the value from user!!
}

<input (input) = "method($event)"></input> 


best way for bidrectional realitionship!

[(ngModel)] = "object.property" -> to use ngModel we should import FormsModule in app.module.ts and add in imports:[]

@Output childEvent = new EventEmit<SomeType>(); -> this use () under the hood
To achive this we SHOULD have child-parent relationship!!! In parent listen for child changes!

@Input test:string -> this use [] under the hood, if we do not use this decorator we can not use property with []
To achive this we SHOULD have parent-child relationship!!! In child received data from parent!
