Peace of user interface.
We should have different components for side bar/headers. Home,About,Courses, Contact.
Everytihink in htm should be separated components and we can build it in Angular.
We can insert component in component! parent -> child realationship
All compontns crate user interface.

Every component should have ts file with @Component decorator.
All components should be declarated in main module file!!!
Child components SHOULD be in parent folder!!!! So all components SHOULD be in app folder?! <componentName></componentName>

@Component({
selector: 'app-className'   -> whit name in '' we can involked this component in html!
templateUrl './className.component.html'  -> every component SHOULD has this peace of sheet. Also should be import in app.module.ts
stylesUrls: ['./className.component.css'] -> also we can use style and add plate css but is not recommened!
})                             

@NgModule
declarations -> there we should add our components!
